Runs in any Browser. 
Easy to set up, although it's fully customizable and responsive.

> **This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Credits

This adapter would not have been possible without the great work of @o0Shojo0o (https://github.com/o0Shojo0o), who developed former releases of this adapter.

## How to report issues and feature requests

Ideally, please use GitHub issues for this, with the best method achieved by setting the adapter to Debug log mode (Instances -> Expert mode -> Column Log level). Then retrieve the logfile from disk via the  'log' ioBroker subdirectory, **not** from Admin, which will cut lines.

## Add to Homescreen
You can save it as Web-App on Homescreen, and it looks and feels like a native app:
![Add to Homescreeen](img/add_to_homescreen.png)

This also works on your PC with Chrome:
* Open iQontrol in Chrome
* Klick on the three-dots-menu - More tools - Create shortcut
* You will then find iQontrol in the start menu under chrome apps and can even add it to your taskbar

## You need...
* Nodejs 10 or higher
* Web-Adapter with one instance running the same protocol (http or https) as the admin-adapter, socket.IO set to 'integrated' and 'Force Web-Sockets' disabled
    * If this stands in conflict to other adapters, simply add another instance with the above settings - iQontrol will search the best fitting web-adapter-instance and use it for communication
	* For connecting over *iobroker.pro-Cloud* both, admin- and web-adapter should be set to http (not https)

* If you experience any problems, please have a look at the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section at the end of this readme

Have a look at the wiki [wiki](https://github.com/sbormann/ioBroker.iqontrol/wiki).


## How to use
**Don't be scared of the many options you have.**
Most things work right out of the box. You *can*, but you don't have to use all the configuration-possibilities iQontrol offers! Just start this way:
* Start creating views.
	You can consider views as something like a page.
* Then create devices on these views.
	Devices have a role, that determines the function of the device, which icons are used and so on.
	Depending on that role you can link several states to the device. These will give the device its functionality.
	If you select 'Link to other view' as role you can create links to other views. I suggest skinning Links to other views with the same Background, the linked view has.
	You can also try to use the Auto-create-Function to choose an existing device from the iobroker-object-tree. Auto-create tries to find out the role and to match as many states as possible.
* Afterwards you can create a toolbar, which is displayed as footer.
	Toolbar-Entries are links to views.
	The first Toolbar-Entry will be your 'Home-View' with will be loaded at start.
* To give everything a fancy style, you can upload your own images.
	You can use your images as background-images for views, or for devices.
	Images in the folder `/usericons` can be used as icons for devices.
	The free builtin demo-wallpapers are from www.pexels.com.

### Use Auto-create
* You'll find a `Autocreate Views`-Button inside the  `Views`-Tab
* If you have well maintained ioBroker enumerations like Rooms or Functions, you can use this function to automatically build Views with the devices listed inside this enumerations
* Keep in mind, because of the large numbers of different adapters and devices inside the ioBroker-universe, the auto-creation feature can not maintain all devices 100% correctly. You may need to rework some settings by hand to get the best results. But auto-create offers you a good starting point to build your own visualization in seconds. 


## URL-Parameters
* The frontend is called via `http[s]://<url or ip of iobroker>:<port of web adapter>/iqontrol/index.html`
    * `<port of web adapter>` is usually 8082
* To open a specified instance you can add `namespace=iqontrol.<instance-number>` as URL-parameter
* To open a specified view you can add `renderView=<viewID>` as URL-parameter.
    * `<viewID>` needs to be formatted like `iqontrol.<instance-number>.Views.<view-name>`
	* Note: this is case-sensitive!
* To open a specified view as homepage you can add `home=<viewID>` as URL-parameter. This will also change the linked view of the first toolbar entry!
    * `<viewID>` needs to be formatted like `iqontrol.<instance-number>.Views.<view-name>`
	* Note: this is case-sensitive!
* To open a specified dialog while loading the page you can add `openDialog=<deviceID>` as URL-parameter
    * `<deviceID>` needs to be formatted like `iqontrol.<instance-number>.Views.<view-name>.devices.<device-number>` where `<device-number>` starts from 0 (so the first device on a view is device number 0)
	* Note: this is case-sensitive!
* To set or override return after time settings, use the following parameters:
    * `returnAfterTimeTreshold=<time in seconds>` to set the time, after which the destination view is called. Use `0` to disable return after time feature.
	* `returnAfterTimeDestiationView=<viewID>` to set the view, which is called after the threshold. If not specified, the home view will be used.
	* These options are helpful, if you call iQontrol from a wall mounted tablet, which should automatically return to home-view after being used 
* To load the page without toolbar you can add `noToolbar=true`
* To load the page without panel you can add `noPanel=true`
* To load the page without toolbar and panel, swiping deactivated, no loading-spinner and with transparent loading-screen you can add `isBackgroundView=true`
* Normally iQontrol uses the language that is set in ioBroker. You can overwrite that by adding `language=<xx>`
	* `<xx>` can be `de`, `en`, `es`, `fr`, `it`, `nl`, `pl`, `pt`, `ru` or `zh-cn` 
* If your iQontrol instance is password protected by a passphrase (see Options - Passphrase-Protection), you can submit the passphrase by adding `passphrase=<MyPassphrase>' 

**Example:**
* `https://192.168.1.1:8082/iqontrol/index.html?namespace=iqontrol.1&home=iqontrol.1.Views.Living-Room`
    * Note upper and lower case


## Fonts
* You can upload your own font files in the Images/Widgets-Tab into the folder `/userfonts`
* In the Options-Tab you have several places where these fonts can be chosen
* It depends on your servers MIME-Settings, if the font is presented correctly to the browser - for me best worked .ttf and .woff (tested on a raspi 4b)
    * These mime-settings should work:
	    * .otf: `application/x-font-opentype`
		* .ttf: `application/x-font-ttf` or `application/x-font-truetype`
		* .woff: `application/font-woff`
		* .woff2: `application/font-woff2`
		* .eot: `application/vnd.ms-fontobject`
	* You can convert fonts to other formats on `fontsquirrel.com` under generator
* Keep in mind - webfonts are always a little tricky and not every font with every server and every browser will work

## Icons and Background-Images
* You can use the inbuilt images or the images uploaded under the images tab or any free url you like
* You can also use a variable inside the image-url. This may be useful for example for weather-forecasts. Use this pattern:
    * `path/to/firstloaded.png|anotherpath/to/{iobrokerstate|fallback}.png`
    * Example: `./../iqontrol.meta/userimages/demo/bottle.jpg|./../iqontrol.meta/userimages/demo/{javascript.0.myimage|whitestone}.jpg` 
	* This loads `./../iqontrol.meta/userimages/demo/bottle.jpg` when you open the view
	* As soon as the state of `javascript.0.myimage` is fetched from the server, the image will be replaced with `./../iqontrol.meta/userimages/demo/XXX.jpg` where `XXX` is the value of `javascript.0.myimage`
	* If `javascript.0.myimage` has no value the fallback `whitestone` will be used (using the fallback is optional)

### Progress Bars
* It is possible, to use SVG-Definitions in combination with variables instead of imagefiles to display progress-bars
* There are a vew templates integrated to chose from, but you can also create your own SVGs

![Progressbar square](img/progressbar_square.png)
![Progressbar circle](img/progressbar_circle.png)

* See [Wiki](https://github.com/sbormann/ioBroker.iqontrol/wiki/Progress-Bars) for further information

### Charts
* You can add the ''FLOT Chart-Widget'' as BACKGROUND_URL of any device, which will automatically display the main state as a chart in the background of the device-tile
* You need to ensure that the state is logged and recorded by one of the history-adapters of ioBroker

![Chart](img/widget_flotchart.png)


## Device-Names
* Just like variables in image-urls you can use variables in device-names. The syntax is almost the same:
    * `Text while loading|Text after loading {iobrokerstate|fallback}`
	* Additionally, can put the iobroker state into square brackets, then the plain value without its unit will be used: `Text while loading|Text after loading {[iobrokerstate]|fallback}`
    * Example: `Weather is loading|Weather: {javascript.0.weather|No weather data found}` 
	* This shows `Weather is loading` when you open the view
	* As soon as the state of `javascript.0.weather` is fetched from the server, the text will be replaced by `Weather: XXX` where `XXX` is the value of `javascript.0.weather`
	* If `javascript.0.weather` has no value the fallback `No weather data found` will be used (using the fallback is optional)


## Popup-Messages
* Every instance creates the state `iqontrol.x.Popup.Message`
	* When passing values to this state, a popup-message (or toast) will be displayed on all **currently** opened iQontrol frontends
* Additionally every instance creates the state `iqontrol.x.Popup.PersistentMessage`
	* When passing values this state, the popup-message will be saved into the PERSISTENT_MESSAGES_PENDING-Array. 
	* Persistent messages will not be only displayed on all currently opened iQontrol frontends, but also on all **in future** opened instances until they are confimed (by click or duration) or they expire.
	* `PersistentExpires` defines, when the persistent message expires as a UNIX-Timestamp (seconds from 1970-01-01 00:00:00). Values lower than 31536000 are interpreted as a duration in seconds from now (31536000 seconds = 1 year).
	* `PersistentUndismissible` *boolean* - If this is set to true, the persistent message will be kept even after it is closed. If you open a new iQontrol instance, it will be displayed again. Otherwise persistent messages are deleted after the popup closes (even by click or when the duration has elapsed).
	* `PersistentId` is an optional arbitrary expression that can be used to identify the message.
		* The id can be used to delete corresponding popup messages by sending the id to `PERSISTENT_MESSAGES_DELETE_ID`. Sending `null` to this datapoint removes all pending messages.
		* The id can also be used to display corresponding popup messages on all currently opened iQontrol-Instances again by sending the id to `PERSISTENT_MESSAGES_SHOW_ID`. Sending `null` to this datapoint shows all pending messages.
	* **Note**: You can send a message to only one of the two data points "Message" or "PersistentMessage", not to both.
* You can use html-tags to format the message text
* There are some additional states for further customization of the displayed popup (these must be set, before the message datapoint is set):
    * `Duration`: This is the time in ms the message is displayed; if set to 0 the message has to be confirmed
    * `ClickedValue` and `ClickedDestinationState`: If the popup is clicked by user, the value from `ClickedValue` will be sent to `iqontrol.x.Popup.POPUP_CLICKED` and, if specified, additional to the datapoint in `ClickedDestinationState` 
        * If no value is specified, `true` will be used
	* `ClickKeepsOpen` *boolean* - if true, the popup can only be closed by clicking on a button, klicking the popup itself will not close it. So make shure you add buttons to your popup-message, as described beneath.
    * `ButtonNames`: Here you can specify a comma separated list of buttons, that will be displayed at the bottom of the popup (for example "OK,Abort")
        * `ButtonValues` and `ButtonDestinationStates`: These are comma separated lists of values that will be sent to `iqontrol.x.Popup.BUTTON_CLICKED` and, if specified, additional to the datapoint in `ButtonDestinationStates`, if the user clickes the corresponding button
		    * Instead of a datapoint you can use the commands `COMMAND:renderView` and `COMMAND:openDialog` as a ButtonDestinationState, to render a view or open a dialog
			* The ButtonValue then specifies the view resp. dialog and needs to be in the format `iqontrol.<instance-number>.Views.<view-name>` resp. `iqontrol.<instance-number>.Views.<view-name>.devices.<device-number>` where `<device-number>` starts from 0 (so the first device on a view is device number 0)
		* If you only use one value (instead of a comma separated list), this value will be used for all buttons
		* If you leave `ButtonValues` empty, the name of the button will be used
		* If you only use one destination state (instead of a comma separated list), this state will be used for all buttons
        * `ButtonCloses`: This is a comma separated list of booleans (`true`/`false`) that specify, if the popup should be closed, when the corresponding button is pressed
        * `ButtonClears`: This is a comma separated list of booleans (`true`/`false`) that specify, if the popup settings should be cleared (= set all popup-states to empty), when the corresponding button is pressed
* Alternatively you can set these values via sendTo-command with the parameters `PopupMessage`, `PopupDuration`, `PopupClickedValue` and so on
    * Example: `sendTo("iqontrol", "send", {PopupMessage: 'This is my message', PopupDuration: 2500, PopupClickedValue: 'messageConfirmed'});`
* You can also use blockly to send messages to iQontrol

## Widgets
* Every tile has a BACKGROUND_URL and a BACKGROUND_HTML datapoint
* Here you can define a link (via BACKGROUND_URL) to a website or place direct HTML-Code (via BACKGROUND_HTML), that will be displayed as background of the tile
* This gives you the possibility to place (interactive) content inside a tile (like clocks, FLOT-charts, tables, weather-forecasts and so on)
* By default, mouse events will be directed to this content (thus you can't click the tile itself anymore), but you can disable this with the option "Direct mouse events to the tile instead to the content of BACKGROUND_VIEW/URL/HTML"
* iQontrol offers a device-role "Widget" which has some predefined options set that will be mostly used when showing a website as widget. But you can achieve the same result with any other role by modifying the devices options properly.

### jQuery
* Technically the content of BACKGROUND_VIEW/URL/HTML is placed inside a HTML-Element called iframe, which is a website inside a website
* In order to use jQuery, you can transfer it from iQontrol to the iFrame with the following code: 
    ``window.$=window.jQuery=parent.jQuery.extend(function(s){return parent.jQuery(s,document)},parent.jQuery);``
* Example:
	```html
	<!doctype html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/>
		<meta name="widget-description" content="This is a demo widget-preset. It has no useful funcion. (C) by Sebastian Bormann"/> 
		<meta name="widget-options" content="{'noZoomOnHover': 'true', 'hideDeviceName': 'true', 'sizeInactive': 'xwideIfInactive highIfInactive', 'iconNoPointerEventsInactive': 'true', 'hideDeviceNameIfInactive': 'true', 'hideStateIfInactive': 'true', 'sizeActive': 'fullWidthIfActive fullHeightIfActive', 'bigIconActive': 'true', 'iconNoPointerEventsActive': 'true', 'hideDeviceNameIfActive': 'true', 'hideStateIfActive': 'true', 'sizeEnlarged': 'fullWidthIfEnlarged fullHeightIfEnlarged', 'bigIconEnlarged': 'true', 'iconNoPointerEventsEnlarged': 'false', 'noOverlayEnlarged': 'true', 'hideDeviceNameIfEnlarged': 'true', 'hideStateIfEnlarged': 'true', 'popupAllowPostMessage': 'true', 'backgroundURLAllowPostMessage': 'true', 'backgroundURLNoPointerEvents': 'false'}"/>
		<title>iQontrol Widget Test</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="testDiv">Loading...</div>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			console.log("JQUERY-TEST");
			window.$=window.jQuery=parent.jQuery.extend(function(s){return parent.jQuery(s,document)},parent.jQuery);
			$(document).ready(function(){
				$('#testDiv').html("<h1>Hello World</h1)");
				console.log("jQuery works!!");
			});
		</script>	
	</body>
	</html>
	```

### postMessage-Communication
* By enabling the option "Allow postMessage-Communication for BACKGROUND_VIEW/URL/HTML" you can enable postMessage-Communication between the widget in its iframe and iQontrol itself
* To send commands to iQontrol you can use the following javascript-command: `window.parent.postMessage(message, "*");` 
    * `message` is a javascript object of the format `{ command: command, stateId: stateId, value: value }`
    * The following message-commands are supported:
        * `{ command: "setWidgetState", stateId: <widgetStateId>, value: <value> }`
			* This will set the ioBroker state `iqontrol.<instance>.Widgets.<widgetStateId>` to the value `<value>` (`<value>` can be a string, number or boolean or an object like `{ val: <value>, ack: true|false }`)
        * `{ command: "getWidgetState", stateId: <widgetStateId> }`
			* This will cause iQontrol to send the value of the ioBroker state `iqontrol.<instance>.Widgets.<widgetStateId>` (see below how to receive the answer-message)
        * `{ command: "getWidgetStateSubscribed", stateId: <widgetStateId> }`
			* This will cause iQontrol to send the value of the ioBroker state `iqontrol.<instance>.Widgets.<widgetStateId>` now and every time its value changes (see below how to receive the answer-messages)
        * `{ command: "setWidgetDeviceState", stateId: <widgetDeviceState>, value: <value> }`
			* This will set the ioBroker datapoint that is assigned to the devices STATE `<widgetDeviceState>` (for example the datapoint, that is assigned to LEVEL) to the value `<value>` (`<value>` can be a string, number or boolean or an object like `{ val: <value>, ack: true|false }`)
        * `{ command: "getWidgetDeviceState", stateId: <widgetDeviceState> }`
			* This will cause iQontrol to send the value of the ioBroker datapoint, that is assigned to the devices STATE `<widgetDeviceState>` (for example the datapoint, that is assigned to LEVEL; see below how to receive the answer-message)
        * `{ command: "getWidgetDeviceStateSubscribed", stateId: <widgetDeviceState> }`
			* This will cause iQontrol to send the value of the ioBroker datapoint, that is assigned to the devices STATE `<widgetDeviceState>` (for example the datapoint, that is assigned to LEVEL) now and every time its value changes (see below how to receive the answer-message)
        * `{ command: "setState", stateId: <stateId>, value: <value> }`
			* This will set the ioBroker state `<stateId>` to the value `<value>` (`<value>` can be a string, number or boolean or an object like `{ val: <value>, ack: true|false }`)
        * `{ command: "getState", stateId: <stateId> }`
			* This will cause iQontrol to send the value of the ioBroker state `<stateId>` (see below how to receive the answer-message)
        * `{ command: "getStateSubscribed", stateId: <stateId> }`
			* This will cause iQontrol to send the value of the ioBroker state `<stateId>` now and every time its value changes (see below how to receive the answer-messages)
        * `{ command: "getOptions"}`
			* This will cause iQontrol to send the user options the user has configured as object
        * `{ command: "renderView", value: <viewID> }`
			* This will instruct iQontrol to render a view, where `<viewID>` needs to be formatted like `iqontrol.<instance-number>.Views.<view-name>` (case-sensitive)
        * `{ command: "openDialog", value: <deviceID> }`
			* This will instruct iQontrol to open a dialog, where `<deviceID>` needs to be formatted like `iqontrol.<instance-number>.Views.<view-name>.devices.<device-number>` where `<device-number>` starts from 0 (so the first device on a view is device number 0)
* To receive messages from iQontrol, you need to register an event-listener to the "message"-event with the javascript-command `window.addEventListener("message", receivePostMessage, false);`
    * The function `receivePostMessage` receives the object `event`
	* `event.data` contains the message from iqontrol, which will be an object like:
	    * event.data = `{ command: "getState", stateId: <stateId>, value: <stateObject> }` - this will be the answer to a `getState`-command or a `getStateSubscribed`-command and gives you the actual `<value>`-object of the ioBroker state`<stateId>`
		* `<stateObject>` itself is an object like 
			```
			event.data.value = {
				val: <value (rounded)>,
				unit: "<unit>",
				valFull: <value (not rounded, no javascript-injection prevention)>,
				plainText: "<clear text of val, for example taken from valuelist>",
				min: <minimum>,
				max: <maximum>,
				step: <step-width>,
				valuelist: {<object with possible values and corresponding clear text>},
				targetValues: {<target value list>},
				ack: <true|false>,
				readonly: <true|false>,
				custom: {<object with custom settings>},
				id: <id of the iobroker datapoint>,
				from: "<source of state>",
				lc: <timestamp of last change>,
				ts: <timestamp of last actualization>,
				q: <quality of signal>,
				role: "<role of state>",
				type: "<string|number|boolean>",
				name: "<name of datapoint>",
				desc: "<description of datapoint>",
				Date: <Date-object (only present, if value is regognized as a valid time or period)>
			}
			```
* To instruct iQontrol to generate a widgetState under `iqontrol.<instance>.Widgets` you can use a meta-tag inside the head-section of the widget-website:
    * Syntax: 
      ```
      <meta name="widget-datapoint" content="WidgetName.StateName" data-type="string" data-role="text" />
      ```
    * You can further configure the datapoint by using data-type (which can be set to string, number or boolean), data-role, data-name, data-min, data-max, data-def and data-unit attributes
    * You can also use a URL-parameter (see below) as a variable, for example to create distinct instances of the widgets with own data points.
        * The Syntax is then:
		  ```
          <meta name="widget-datapoint" content="WidgetName.StateName|WidgetName.{instance}.StateName" data-type="string" data-role="text" />
          ```
        * If the variable `instance` is set, then the part after the `|` will be used as widgetState-Name and `{instance}` will be replaced by the value of `instance`
        * If the variable `instance` is not set, then the part before the `|` will be used as `wigdetState`-Name
    * The corresponding datapoint is only then created, if the widget-website is added to a device as URL or BACKGROUND_URL	
* The same concept may be used for the URL/HTML-State, which is used to display a website inside the dialog of a device
* To create an icon for your widget place a .png file with the same filename as the widget into the widgets directory
* See below for an example widget-website:

<details>
<summary>Show example widget-website to be displayed as widget with postMessage-communication: (<ins>klick to open</ins>)</summary>

* You can use the following HTML code and copy it to the BACKGROUND_HTML-State of a widget (which then needs to be configured as "Constant") 
* As an alternative you can upload this code as html-file into the `/userwidgets` subdirectory and reference it to BACKGROUND_URL-State (which then also needs to be configured as "Constant")
* Activate the option "Allow postMessage-Communication for BACKGROUND_VIEW/URL/HTML"
* It will demonstrate how a two-way communication between the website and iQontrol is done

### Further configuration of widgets
* There are additional meta-tags, you can use inside the head-section of your widget-website to configure the behavior of the widget:
	* `widget-description`
		* syntax: 
		  ```  
          <meta name="widget-description" content="Please see www.mywebsite.com for further informations. (C) by me"/>
          ```
		* The content will be displayed when choosing the widget as URL or BACKGROUND_URL or if you auto-create a widget
	* `widget-urlparameters`
		* syntax: 
		  ```
          <meta name="widget-urlparameters" content="parameter/default value/description/type;parameter2/default value2/description2/type2"/>
          ```
 		* The user will be asked for these parameters when choosing the widget as URL or BACKGROUND_URL or auto-creates a widget
		* `type` is optional and may be `text` (this is default), `number`, `checkbox`, `color`, `select`, `multipleSelect`, `combobox`, `historyInstance`, `datapoint`, `listJsonDatapoint`, `icon`, `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `fontStyle`, `fontWeight`, `language`, `section`, `divider`, `info`, `link` or `hidden`
		    * If type is `select`, `multipleSelect` or `combobox` then you need to specify the possible options by adding `/<selectOptions>`, where `<selectOptions>` is a string of the format `<value1>,<caption1>/<value2>,<caption2>/...` (combobox is a selectbox with the possibility to enter free text)
		    * If type is `number` then can specify min, max and step-width by adding `/<numberOptions>`, where `<numberOptions>` is a string of the format `<min>,<max>,<step>`
			* The types `section`, `divider`, `info` and `link` have no further function, they are just to display information to the user. For `link` the value should be a URL, but all slashes have to be replaced by backslashes.
		    * Type `hidden` will be passed to the widget, but no configuration dialog is shown
		* All these parameters will be given to the widget-website via a URL-parameter-string (like `widget.html?parameter=value&parameter2=value2`)
		* You can use these settings inside your widget-website by requesting the URL-parameters with a function like this:
			```
			function getUrlParameter(name) {
				name = name.replace(/[\[]/, '\\[').replace(/[\]]/, '\\]');
				var regex = new RegExp('[\\?&]' + name + '=([^&#]*)');
				var results = regex.exec(location.search);
				return results === null ? null : decodeURIComponent(results[1].replace(/\+/g, ' '));
			};
			```
		    * If you used type `icon` for your URL-parameter then you will get either a path relative to the iqontrol-directory or an absolute path to an image. To create a valid link to your image you can use this code:
			    ```
				var iconOn = getUrlParameter('iconOn') || './images/icons/switch_on.png';
				if(iconOn.indexOf('http') != 0) iconOn = '/iqontrol/' + iconOn;
				```

	* `widget-options`
		* syntax: 
		  ```
          <meta name="widget-options" content="{'noZoomOnHover': 'true', 'hideDeviceName': 'true'}"/>
          ```
		* See the expandable section below for the possible options that can be configured by this meta-tag

	* `widget-replaceurl`
        * syntax: 
          ```
          <meta name="widget-replaceurl" content="<url>" data-absolute="<true|false>"/>
		  ```
        * This reconfigures the used URL/BACKGROUND_URL for this widget (this way you could define widget-presets, that are used to give special or simplified configurations to the user. But when calling the widget, iQontrol uses the given `<url>` instead of the original URL.
        * By default, only the filename (with extension) is replaced. When setting `data-absolute=`true`` then the whole URL is replaced.

## Lists and Counters
iQontrol provides a powerful tool to create dynamic lists and counters of devices and states. 

Thus, for example, all open windows can be automatically counted and also visualized in a list. Another example would be the lamps currently switched on in the house. 

Service messages can also be created that way, for example by counting the devices that cannot be reached or the devices with an empty battery. iQontrol updates the lists then automatically.

To visualize the counted devices, you can use the Device-Counter-Widget, which provides an easy but yet highly customizable interface. Experts could also use the JSON-Table-Widget, which provides even more configuration-possibilities (the Device-Counter-Widget is a simplified Version of the JSON-Table-Widget).

### Create a List
* Go to the LISTS/COUNTERS tab, create a list and give it a unique name. Click on **edit**
* In the upper part you have to define the **selectors**: 
	* This list will be processed from top to bottom. 
	* At any position you can add or remove items by defining conditions. This will generate your **TOTAL_LIST**.
	* Conditions consist of the following parts:
		* Modifier: Add or Remove items to the list
		* Type: Chose what to add or remove to or from the list. Type could be:
			* **All** - self-explaining
			* **Enumeration** - filter by enumeration. You can define enumerations, like 'rooms', 'functions' or 'windows upper floor' in ioBroker admin adapter
			* **Enumeration with Children** - enumerations contain often only the device without it's datapoints. Therefore, you will mostly use Enumeration with Children, which automatically includes the data points as well
			* **ID** - filter by the ID of data points, for example remove IDs that don't end with '.color' or '.saturation'
			* **Object-Type** - filter by Object-Type, which can be device, channel, state or enumeration
			* **Type** - filter by the `common.type` of the datapoint, for example string, number, boolean
			* **Role** - filter by the `common.role` of the datapoint. This is one of the most important filters, as every datapoint should have a `common.role` that describes, what it stands for, for example switch, `indicator.unreach` or level.color.rgb. There are a plenty of common roles inside ioBroker, just have a look at your data points, the admin-adapter provides a list with all of them
		* Compare operators: Some Types can be compared with a value. The operator stands for the comparison that is done, like 'is greater than', 'is lower than' or, for strings, 'begins with' or 'contains':
			* They work case-insensitive (so 'Text' is the same as 'text')
			* You can also compare with multiple values at one time if you provide comma-separated list of arguments
				* Example: `|remove|ID|doesn't end with|.error,.overheat|` will remove all IDs that don't end with '.error' OR with '.overheat'
		* Value: The value the compare operator compares to
	* You can also **filter for Aliases**: This is useful if you for example create a list that counts devices with low batteries. But you don't want it to count both, the original device, and its alias. So filter alias ensures, that data points, that have an alias in the list, will be removed
* Next you can define **counters**:
	* You can define several counters that count for given conditions in your TOTAL_LIST. Let`s say, you have created a list with all your LOW-BATTERY-Data-points. Now you want to count, how many of them are active at the moment, i.e. have the status 'true'. That is done by a counter
	* You have to assign a name to every counter
	* You can assign a unit to every counter
	* You need to define at least one condition for every counter. To do so, click on the edit-icon:
		* Add as many conditions, as you like
		* The conditions are processed from top to bottom
		* The conditions can be linked with AND or with OR operators, so you can build complex conditions for your counter
	* The counters update everytime a datapoint in your TOTAL_LIST is changes
	* Additionally, you can set a specific **time interval** at which the counter will be updated (for example if you count, how many devices you have with a timestamp older than 5 minutes - this requires a periodically checking)
* Next you can define **calculations**:
	* Calculations can be used to combine numeric data points and calculate for example the sum of different counters.
	* You can also combine objects like arrays (lists) by addition or subtraction.
* Then you can define **combinations**:
	* Combinations can be used to combine different data points with text.
	* The 'Prefix' will be placed before, the 'Postfix' after the value of the given ID.
	* In the 'Only If'-Section you can define a condition, if the line should be placed or not.
		* By activating 'Just Prefix' just the prefix is placed (not the value nor the postfix), if the condition matches.
		* You can also specify a 'Else' text, that will be placed, if the condition doesn't match.
* At least you can define **logs**:
	* Logs can be used to log changes in data points with timestamp in a table.
	* Everytime a value of one of the given IDs changes, the log is updated. 
		* By adding a debounce-time, you can prevent it from updating to often (for example if some values change nearly simultaneously).
	* The log is a table, that consists of as many columns as you like. 
		* You have to assign unique names to the columns. 
		* Then the content of the column can be defined: the entry number, a timestamp or the value of an ID.
	* The result of the log is saved as JSON-Code and can be displayed by the JSON-Table-Widget.

* The result of the lists with counters, calculations, combinations and logs are saved in data points, which you will find under iqontrol.x.Lists

### Examples
* This example shows, how to create an UNREACH-List:
	![List Edit Unreach](img/list_edit_unreach.png)
	* The selectors first add all Data points with the common role `indicator.unreach`
	* But it then removes all Data points with `STICKY_` in its ID (`homematic` provides the `STICKY_UNREACH`-Indicator, which we don't want to count)
	* It filters duplicates by aliases out
	![List Edit Unreach](img/list_edit_unreach_counter.png)
	* And lastly, it counts all data points with the value `true`, that have that state for at least 15 seconds
* There are some built in default lists you can add, for example complex Service-Messages and a Adapter-Monitor. Just hit the 'Add Default Lists' button and chose what to add. Feel free to examine the lists, to get a better understanding, how they work.

### Wiki
* There is a very good Explanation with some good Enhancements by `dslraser` in the wiki: [wiki](https://github.com/sbormann/ioBroker.iqontrol/wiki/Listen-Z%C3%A4hler)
* Here you can find some tips for configuring the icon-replacements in the device-counter widget: [wiki](https://github.com/sbormann/ioBroker.iqontrol/wiki/JSON-Table-and-Device-Counter-Widget---Icon-Replacements)


## Modifying Datapoint Configuration
You can modify the configuration of data points via the wrench-icon (or rather gear-icon in new react-ui) behind a datapoint in the device-configuration dialog or in objects-tab of iobroker. 

![CustomDialog Call](img/custom_call.png)
![CustomDialog Example](img/custom_dialog.png)

Here you can:
* Set Readonly-Flag
* Set Invert-Flag
* Set Confirm-Flag (forces the user to confirm before a change is written to a datapoint)
* Set PIN-Code (forces the user to enter this PIN-Code before a change is written to a datapoint - but take care: this is only of low security, because the pin is checked in frontend! Use a number to display a fullscreen-pin-pad if asked for code)
* Modify unit of datapoint, separate for zero, singular and plural values
* Modify min and max of datapoint
* Set the steps that a level-slider takes when it is increased/decreased
* Modify type of datapoint
* Modify role of datapoint
* Set a target-value-id, which is a datapoint id, where target values are written to (if you have different data points for the actual and the target value)
* Set or modify a Value-List
    * Add optionally an option to value list to enter free text
* Set a target-value-list:
    * In addition to the target-value-id, you can define different datapoint-ids and target-values for different keys (keys are possible values of the original datapoint)
    * You can also use the wildcard `*` in the keys and in the target-values
	* Example: 
	    * Key: `TuneIn-Playlist: *`, Target-Datapoint ID: `alexa2.0.Echo-Devices.XYZ.Music-Provider.TuneIn-Playlist`, Target-Value: `*`
	    * If the user enters `TuneIn-Playlist: Ambient` the value `Ambient` will be written to `alexa2.0.Echo-Devices.XYZ.Music-Provider.TuneIn-Playlist`

## Description of roles and associated states
Every device has a role, which defines the function of the device. Every role generates a set of states, which can be linked to a corresponding iobroker state.
If you use the auto-create-function, you can choose an existing device from the iobroker-object tree. Auto-create tries to find out the role and to match as many states as possible.
This will only work for known devices. For unknown devices, and to give devices advanced features, you can add them manually via the (+)-Button or edit the devices that were created by auto-create.
To edit the role and the states of a device, click on the pencil behind the device. You will find a short description of the roles and the used states below:
  
### General states:
#### STATE and LEVEL
Almost all roles have a **STATE**- and/or a **LEVEL**-state. In most cases this represents the main function of the device. You can assign iobroker-states of the following types to it:
* *boolean* - if possible, it will be translated to a sensible text like `on/off`, `opened/closed` or similar. If you click on the icon of a tile it tries to toggle the boolean (for example to turn a light on or off). If it is not read-only it will generate a flip-switch in the dialog
* *number* - will be displayed with its corresponding unit and generate a slider in the dialog
* *string* - a text to be displayed
* *value-list* - the selected value will be displayed. If it is not write-protected it will generate a drop-down-menu in dialog 
    * Technically a *value-list* is a value with a corresponding translation-list, defined in the `common.custom.iqontrol.<instance>.states`, `native.states` or `common.states` object of the datapoint:
        ```
        "native": {
            "states": {`true`: "Text for true", `false`: "Text for false"},
            ...
        }
        ```
    * You can create your own value list by modifying the datapoint (wrench-icon, or rather gear-icon in new react-ui, behind the datapoint in the objects-tab of iobroker, see above)
	* iQontrol will display a defined valueList as a drop-down field in the dialog under the following circumstances:
	    * if type is `number` and the valueList has exact as many entries, as steps between min- and max of the datapoint or
		* if type is `boolean`, but role is not `switch` or
		* if type is `string` or
		* if "Add option to enter free text" is activated
* If the device-tile will be displayed as active or inactive is also determined from the STATE or LEVEL-Datapoint. Furthermore, you can freely customize the behavior in the options section 'Conditions for an Active Tile'. You can even set another external datapoint that determines the state of the tile

However, not every type makes sense to every role. So the STATE of a switch for example will be a boolean in most cases, to be able to be toggled between on and off. A string may be displayed, but the switch will not be functional.

#### Further general states:
* **INFO_A** and **INFO_B**: *array* - an array of data points and icons, that will be cyclical displayed in the upper right side of the tile

    ![INFO_A and INFO_B](img/info_a_info_b.png)
* **ADDITIONAL_CONTROLS**: *array* - an array of data points, that define additional control elements that will be displayed inside info-dialog. You can use variables inside names and captions (use the same syntax as for normal device-names)
* **ADDITIONAL_INFO**: *array* - an array of data points, that will be displayed at the bottom of the info-dialog
* **URL**: CONSTANT or DATAPOINT *string* - this URL will be opened as iframe inside the dialog
* **HTML**: CONSTANT or DATAPOINT *string* - this markup will be displayed inside the iframe, if no URL-Datapoint is specified
* **BACKGROUND_URL**: CONSTANT or DATAPOINT *string* - this URL will be shown as background of the device-tile. It is placed above the background-images, but you can configure it to be hidden, if the tile is active or inactive. Please have a further look at the widget-section of this manual
* **BACKGROUND_HTML**: CONSTANT or DATAPOINT *string* - this markup will be displayed as background of the device-tile, if no BACKGROUND_URL is specified
* **BATTERY**: *boolean* - when true or *number* - when less than 10%, a little battery-empty-icon will be displayed
    * You can further customize the behaviour of the battery-icon in the options section 'BATTERY Empty Icon'
* **ERROR**: *boolean* - when true, a little exclamation-mark-icon will be displayed
* **UNREACH**: *boolean* - when true, a little wireless-icon will be displayed
    * Behaviour can be inverted in the 'General' section of options (use `connected` instead of `unreach`)
* **ENLARGE_TILE**: *boolean* - when true, the tile will be set as enlarged. You can overwrite that by clicking the enlarge/reduce button. But everytime the state of ENLARGE_TILE changes, it will take over control of the tiles' enlargement state again. If the role of `ENLARGE_TILE` is `button`, then every state change will toggle the enlargement state
* **BADGE**: *number* or *string* - if a value other than zero/false is present, then a badge in the upper left corner is shown with this value. Can be configured to be also shown even if the value is zero or to ignore the unit
    * **BADGE_COLOR**: *string* - any valid html-color-string (like 'green', '#00FF00', 'rgba(0,255,0,0.5)' and so on) that represents the color of the badge. If not present or invalid red with 20% transparency will be used.

    ![Badge](img/badge.png)
* **OVERLAY_INACTIVE_COLOR** and **OVERLAY_ACTIVE_COLOR**: *string* - any valid html-color-string (like 'green', '#00FF00', 'rgba(0,255,0,0.5)' and so on) that represents the color of the overlay of the tile (depending on whether the tile is active of inactive). If no valid color-string is given, the standard-overlay-color (which can be configured in iQontrol-Options) is used. Keep in mind, that there is an option to define the transparency of the overlay in the iQontrol options, which will affect the appearance of the set overlay color.
	* For lights, you can also use the option "Use color of lamp as OVERLAY_ACTIVE_COLOR" which can be found in the device specific options. 

    ![Overlay Color](img/overlay_color.png)

* **GLOW_INACTIVE_COLOR** and **GLOW_ACTIVE_COLOR**: *string* - any valid html-color-string (like `green`, `#00FF00`, `rgba(0,255,0,0.5)` and so on) that represents the color of a glow-effect around the tile (depending on whether the tile is active of inactive). If no valid color-string is given, the glow-effect is disabled.
	* **GLOW_HIDE**: *boolean* - if true, the glow-effect is hidden (can be inverted in the 'General' section of options)	
	* For lights, you can also use the option "Use color of lamp as GLOW_ACTIVE_COLOR" which can be found in the device specific options.

* Has no further states
* The **linked-view-property** is opened directly

### <img src="img/icons/switch_on.png" width="32"> Switch:
* **STATE**: *boolean* - display and set on/off-state
* **POWER**: *number* - power-consumption that will be displayed in small in the upper right corner

### <img src="img/icons/button.png" width="32"> Button:
* **STATE**: *any* - any desired type of state
* **SET_VALUE**: CONSTANT *string* - this is a constant (not a linked iobroker-state!) that will be assigned to the STATE if the button is pressed
* **OFF_SET_VALUE**: CONSTANT *string* - this is a constant (not a linked iobroker-state!). If defined, STATE will be reset to this value after the in options defined time or 100ms

### <img src="img/icons/light_on.png" width="32"> Light:
Every light may have one or both of the following states:
* **STATE**: *boolean* - show and set on/off-state
* **LEVEL**: *number* - show and set the level of the light

Optional you can define the following states:
* For colored LEDs (HSB-color-space):
    * **HUE**: *number* - color of the light from 0-360° (hue format)
    * **SATURATION**: *number* - saturation of the light (from white to pure color)
    * **COLOR_BRIGHTNESS**: *number* - the brightness of the colored LEDs (if you have a LEVEL-State and no white LEDs, this is ignored, because brightness is controlled completely by LEVEL)
* For white LEDs:
    * **CT**: *number* - color-temperature of the light, if it has two shades of white
    * **WHITE_BRIGHTNESS**: *number* - the brightness of the white LEDs (if you have a LEVEL-State and no colored LEDs, this is ignored, because brightness is controlled completely by LEVEL)
* Alternative color spaces:
    * **ALTERNATIVE_COLORSPACE_VALUE**: *string* or *number* (depending on the chosen colorspace) - the value of the alternative colorspace
    If your device does not support using HUE, SATURATION and COLOR_BRIGHTNESS (HSB/HSV-colorspace) you can use a variety of alternative color spaces. In the device-options you can choose one of the following color spaces:	
        * **RGB** / **#RGB**: instead of using HUE, SATURATION and COLOR_BRIGHTNESS you can use the RGB-Format (hex), optional with leading '#'
        * **RGBW** / **#RGBW**: instead of using HUE, SATURATION, COLOR_BRIGHTNESS and WHITE_BRIGHTNESS you can use the RGBW-Format (hex), optional with leading '#'
        * **RGBWWCW** / **#RGBWWCW** / **RGBCWWW** / **#RGBCWWW**: instead of HUE, SATURATION, COLOR_BRIGHTNESS, CT and WHITE_BRIGHTNESS you can use the RGBWWCW- or RGBCWWW-Format (hex, WW = warm white, CW = cold white), optional with leading '#'
        * **RGB (Hue only)** / **#RGB (Hue only)**: instead of using HUE you can use the RGB (Hue only)-Format (hex), optional with leading '#'. In this special case the RGB-Format will only accept pure saturated colors of the hue-color-circle. Mixed white is not allowed
        * **Hue for Milight**: This is the Hue-Value for Milight-Devices (v5), with use another starting-point in the hue color-circle: 
            ```
    		MilightHue = modulo(66 - (hue / 3.60), 100) * 2.55; 
    		hue = modulo(-3.60 * (MilightHue/2.55 - 66), 360);
    		function modulo(n, m){ return ((n % m) + m) %m; }
            ```
        * **HHSSBB for Tuya**: 12 digit long hex-string, representing hue (HH = 0000-016d [0-365]), saturation (SS = 0000-03e8 [0-1000]) and color-brightness (BB =  0000-03e8 [0-1000])
	Keep in Mind: Conversion to alternative colorspace is done by frontend, so it is only active, if iQontrol is opened somewhere. Therefore, you can't use it as a converter for color spaces. To avoid conversation-loops it is recommended to either use the original colorspace-data-points (HUE, SATURATION, COLOR_BRIGHTNESS, CT, WHITE_BRIGHTNESS) *or* the alternative colorspace-datapoint to *replace* these data points. 
* Effect-Mode:
    * **EFFECT**: *value-list* - the effect to play
	* **EFFECT_NEXT**: *boolean* - if set to true, the next effect will play (as an alternative for devices that don't support EFFECT-value list)
	* **EFFECT_SPEED_UP** / **EFFECT_SPEED_DOWN**: *boolean* - if set to true, the effect will speed up/down
* Miscellaneous:
    * **POWER**: *number* - power-consumption that will be displayed in small in the upper right corner

### <img src="img/icons/fan_on.png" width="32"> Fan:
* **STATE**: *boolean* - display and set on/off-state

* In the custom-section (wrench-icon or rather gear-icon in new react-ui) of any datapoint you can configure time-format and time-display-format. If the datapoint contains time information, these two parameters specify in which format the time is saved in the datapoint and how iQontrols displays the time to the user.
* For the 'Date and Time'-Device these two settings can also be made in the device options inside the device-specific section. These will overwrite the settings made in the custom-section of the datapoint.
* You can use the following tokens:
